    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important for universities to plan effective strategies on student recruitment. It is also a huge decision for parents and students to decide what university to attend. There are many aspects that every student and family need to consider in making the college decision. Student enrollment rate (yield rate), first-year retention rate, and graduation rate are vitally important measurements of institution’s quality and commitment to student success. These three aspects also indicate if the institution is providing the necessary services and resources to attract students, help students make the transition from high school, and keep students satisfied with their college experience. In the meanwhile, for higher education administrators and leaders, it is significant to have some strong knowledge of factors that influence how students choose universities to study at, wish to continue there and finish their degrees in a timely manner. Student enrollment rate, first-year retention rate, and graduation rate have presented an accurate depiction on if the institution made wise decisions on who will be accepted and be successful at that college, which plays an important role while recruiting new students. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. News national university ranking is an important and easy way for parents and students to find the information on all aspects of an institution. More and more institutional leaders are aware of the impact rankings can have on applicants. Therefore, there is a need for institutions to attain a higher ranking by focusing on targeted measures and actions. This study will examine how ranking indictors can influence student enrollment rate, first-year retention rate, and graduation rate, which are listed on the ranking and have attracted the most attention. \n",
    "\n",
    "Potential stakeholders in this study include but are not limited to university leaders and deans, and other administrators who are affiliated with the institution. This study will allow potential stakeholders to determine which indictors and areas to be relevant in improving the ranking. We’ll split this study into three parts based on three dependent variables - student enrollment rate, first-year retention rate, and graduation rate. Each of three group members will be responsible for one part. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Student Enrollment Rate (Yield Rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the higher education institutions are confronted with the challenges of the decrease in student enrollments and high competition for these students among institutions. On the one hand, students apply to more schools, which can increase the options when it’s time to make a decision. On the other hand, universities have found it challenging to boost their enrollment rates - the percentage of students who enroll at a university after being accepted. Factors that influence the decisions of students to choose universities to study at vary from student to student. It is important for institutions to know factors that influence students’ choices. U.S.News national university ranking gives parents and students an important clue about how well a school is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on U.S.News data, Harvard University had the highest enrollment rate with 82.8% for Fall 2017 among all ranked national universities in the country. Keling (2007) stated that the most influential factor that students will evaluate in selecting their choice of institution was reputation of the institution. However, from the article of “National Universities Where Most Accepted Students Enroll” published on U.S. News website, there are 24 universities reporting a minimum enrollment rate of 50% for fall 2017. Among them, Brigham Young University (Provo), ranked the third highest rate, has a 80.7% enrollment rate, and Yeshiva university ranked 21st has a 53% enrollment rate. It seems that for some universities the ranking did not weaken their enrollment rates. Therefore, in my study, I will focus on how ranking indicators and other factors influence and predict the enrollment rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The following research questions will guide the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What statistically significant association exits between independent variables and the enrollment rate?\n",
    "2. What significant association exits between independent variables and the enrollment rate for public universities?\n",
    "3. What significant association exits between independent variables and the enrollment rate for private universities?\n",
    "4. To what extent does independent variables predict the enrollment rate?\n",
    "5. To what extent does independent variables predict the enrollment rate of public universities?\n",
    "6. To what extent does independent variables predict the enrollment rate of private universities?\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables from U.S. News to be examined are Peer Assessment Score, High school counselor assessment score, Faculty resources rank, Percent of classes under20, Percent of classes of 50 or more students, Student faculty ratio, SAT/ACT 25th 75th percentile, First year students in top 10 of high school class, Financial resources rank, and Average alumni giving rate. Other independent variables include location, tuition, availability of financial aid, and the total number of full-time faculty, which will be collected from IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System). \n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variables will be calculated using the total admission number and the total of enrollment number. Both of these two values will be collected from IPEDS. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data to be Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "U.S. News National University ranking data 2019 will be used for this study. This data was downloaded by YU Office of Institutional Research by following the link in the email that U.S. News sent to the office. The link for downloading this data was valid for only two weeks. This data is also available online to the members of U.S. News website. Original data file downloaded from this source is a SPSS file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "IPEDS data will be obtained through Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System website. Both SPSS and csv files are available online. We’ll use the unique institution ID to merge the data from U.S.News and IPEDS. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we’ll use Python to load the SPSS file (U.S. News ranking), and load CSV file (IPEDS data). And then we'll use python to merge data from all data sources together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I’ll do exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize data main characteristics, and use visual methods, such as bar chart, scatter plot, and bar histogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll use correlation analysis for research questions 1-3 to examine relationships between independent variables and student enrollment rate. Correlation coefficient is the percentage of variation in the dependent variable that is explainable by the predictor variables. The correlation heatmap will be used for visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the list of influential variables is narrowed from the results of correlation analysis, linear regression analyses will be conducted to examine the contribution of each variable to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For research questions 4-6, linear regression analyses will be conducted to estimate the extent to which independent variables can predict student enrollment rate and generate predictions. I’ll use the sklearn.linear_model module to create the model and get predictions from the model. Also, I’ll use scatter to visualize the prediction. \n",

    "#### Retention Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "First-year retention rate examines how many students start their freshman year and then returns their sophomore year. A high retention rate shows that first-year students are happy with the school and wish to continue there. They also show that schools are providing the necessary services to keep students happy and prosperous while at school. While there is no single way to define student success, the most common measure in academic research is retention. Since first-year retention rate is such an important indicator to schools and students, which factors can affect it is a necessary question we need to answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Several questions are going to be solved: Do private universities have a better retention performance than public ones? Do financial resources and city university locates influence retention rate? Can we draw a regression to predict the next year retention?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many statements like public colleges have worse first-year retention in the US. Scott White, Director of Guidance at Montclair High School, said \"Public colleges always have lower rates due to their mission. They have more students who drop out for economic reasons.\" [1] Whether data analysis of our dataset matches his idea will be the first task, to figure out whose retention performance is better, private or public?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the financial section, \"Whalen and Shelly include loan aid, gift aid, work study aid, and the student's need in their retention model. All variables are statistically significant and in the expected direction (i.e., more aid = higher probability of retention; greater need = lower probability of retention).\" [1] To verify the financial factor's affect on retention rate or not, we will see how financial resources rank in the dataset relate to retention rate. Besides, tuition fee data is to be a factor to be analyzed. So we can see how financial resources positively affect retention rate, and how tuition fee affects it negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most people's mind, location should be considered as the leading cause for university choosing. To find some new factors to the retention rate, we include city university locates and some other data relating to the city, to see if any relationship exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, many variables are seen as critical factors to college first-year retention rate, such as  SAT/ACT, school ranking, faculty-student ratio, etc. [2]  I want to work out a correlation between most factors that I have in the dataset and the retention rate. Moreover, a retention rate regression is going to be drawn as a prediction method, which may be used in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data to be used\n",
    "\n",
    "We find an SPSS dataset, best national universities from 2019 U.S. News & World  Report, as our primary database. It includes columns such as 2019 ranking, school name of the top 226, public/private, average first-year retention rate, financial resources rank, and location ( I only show the columns I will use here). It is planned to transfer to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, tuition fee of each school information is coming from the IPEDS website, and it can be downloaded as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For the question the public/private universities have different retention rate, I plan to use group and aggregation function, draw a correlation and build a scatter plot to see what will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second question, I want to build a subset containing financial resources rank, tuition fee, and retention rate. Then find some relations between them. Maybe a factor bar plot in Seaborn will be applied to draw graphs. Alternatively, a scatter plot is better to show a relationship between financial resources ranking and retention rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For location factor,  I want to build a subset containing location and retention rate. Then try to find some relations between location and retention rate. Maybe a factor bar plot in Seaborn will be applied to draw graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, I want to work out a correlation between most factors in the dataset and the retention rate, find out which elements are key factors. Moreover, I am going to draw a regression equation as a prediction method.\n",

    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ‘U.S. News & World Report – Best National Universities’, they take graduation rate performance into consideration, which totally occupied 8% weight (1). That means graduation rate can affect the college rankings directly. But what affects graduation rate? \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the top 50 universities in the United States, Princeton and Yale have the highest graduation rate (97%), followed by Dartmouth (96%). University of Texas has the lowest graduation rate, at 83%. University of Texas has 17% of students who can't graduate, but that's not to say that the school's teaching quality is poor. Jeff suggests there may be “Peer Assessment” such that “being around other students who want to finish college makes a significant difference.” Positive peer pressure, in other words – a high graduation rate may mean an environment in which graduating is highly valued and encouraged. (2) From this we can see that there is more than one factor affecting the graduation rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we prepared some question to see the phenomenon between graduation rates and factors and find influencing factors of graduation rates. We would refer to 2019 U.S. News & World Report – Best National Universities and IPEDS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tIs the effect of graduation rate on university ranking the same as that calculated by U.S. News’? \n",
    "2.\tDoes university ranking affect graduation rate?\n",
    "3.\tIs there a difference between graduation rates of public universities and the rates of private universities?\n",
    "4.\tWhat is kind of difference of graduation rates between public and private?\n",
    "5.\tCan we think there is a relationship between school resource and graduation rates, such as class size, faculty resource rank etc.?\n",
    "6.\tWhat is Best student/faculty ratio in different kind of ranked college?\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tWill high school performance have a bearing on college graduation rates?\n",
    "8.\tCan we think that a high graduation rate may mean an environment in which graduating is highly valued and encouraged?\n",
    "9.\tDoes the school require SAT score for the graduation rate?\n",
    "10.\tWhat is the impact of tuition fees on school graduation rates in different ranking schools?\n",
    "\n",
    "By studying the influencing factors of graduation rate, we can indirectly find the influencing factors of University ranking. There are more than 6000 colleges and universities in the US, and it can be difficult for prospective students, especially young people, to know how to choose. It’s worth knowing what graduation rate means when you’re deciding which college is the best value for individuals. (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Graduation rates may be low, if students could not get the academic support they need to succeed (Faculty Resource), that they are disappointed by the faculty (Class Size) or number of staff (Student/Faculty ratio), or that they might find learning at the school difficult (SAT). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data to be Used\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the questions above, we need to collect the attributes following:\n",
    "Ranking (overall score), Location (State/City), SAT (25% and 75%), Public/Private, Peer Assessment, High School Counselor Score, Faculty Resources Rank, Class Size, Tuition and Student/Faculty ratio. These data can be found in ‘U.S. News & World Report – Best National Universities’ in 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, we are going to use normal Data cleaning to get clean data. Changing data types, such as: Replace Public/Private with 1/0; Replace Student/Faculty ratio with integer. Through data types conversion, we can get numeric data, then use it for measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, deal with missing data and statistical analysis. In this part, we need to do EDA to analyze the Ranking. We will attempt to describe the graduation rates of top25, top 50 and top100 ranked university and verify that the effect of graduation rate on university ranking is same as that calculated by U.S. News’. Moreover, we can use seaborn and matplotlib to sketch the boxplot, joint plot, heatmap and scatter to show the relationship between graduation rate and numeric data (SAT percentile, Faculty Resources Rank, High School Counselor Score, Tuition and Student/Faculty ratio). That will give us a clear version of their relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we are going to make a good plan to help find best value colleges for students and predict the graduation next year per university. We will try to find each attribute occupies what proportion through a linear regression. After that, we will use 2019’s data to predict graduation rate of ranked school. To find the best value colleges for students, we can use aggregation to show the difference among colleges with long format and graphic. Students can put in their demand and see the tendency of target colleges.\n",
